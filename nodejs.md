# Node.js

## What is Node.js?

### A JavaScript run-time environment

A run-time environment is a software that contains an application and provides with an execution environment. It sends instructions to the process and can access system resources on behalf of the running application.

Node.js is a run-time environment that includes everything necessary to run a JavaScript program on a server.

Node.js is an asynchronous event driven JavaScript run-time environment designed to build scalable network applications.

The runtime's scalability comes from its non-blocking concurrency model. Most common concurrency models employ OS threads to handle network operations.

I/O refers to the application's input/output interaction with the system's disk or network. I/O typically involved a waiting time (waiting for the disk to be written, waiting for an HTTP response form an external API).
